# Personal QMK Workspace

For ease of maintaining and archiving my layouts without all the other noise

## Plan

One day this will have an application (probably console) to pull in the latest firmware and build any (or all) keymaps.

## TODO

- Add ASCII Keymaps for posterity (or myself)
- Other stuff...?
